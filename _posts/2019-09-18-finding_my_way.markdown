Starting a new career journey at 28 years old being married, with two beautiful girls (5 years old, and a 4 month old) is not a position I thought I'd find myself in. After the birth of my second daughter I needed to reevaluate my life and I wanted a career instead of going from pointless job to job. In highschool I took a web design course, which sparked my interest in coding but I didn't think I could turn that into a career. I was a clueless kid in highschool when it came to figuring out my career/passion. Fast forward ten years, as I look at my girls aka "My Why" I know it's time to put an end to this never ending cycle of mediocrity. I decided to do some research and do something that'll challenge me mentally and also provide me the opportunity to take care of my family. It's been about a month and it is challenging and, everyday I look into this terrifying thing on my screen that's called a terminal I remember why I chose to switch career paths. I'm happy I chose Flatiron to push me to my next level in life.
