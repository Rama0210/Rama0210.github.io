When I thought of creating my first project I couldn't get that uneasy feeling in my stomach to settle for awhile, come to think of it I'm still not sure it did. The first thing I had to tackle was figuring out what direction I needed to go. So after going back and forth, I choose something that I love and no it didn't have anything to do with food. I choose to work on an application that would look at the roster for the high school team I was an assistant coach for. My goal for this project was to have a menu of the positions labeled "1-9" starting from Quarterback to Cornerback. The user would select a number and to see who played that position along with some details (i.e height, weight, class, town) for that particular player. Setting up the menu wasn't that difficult but getting the correct ouput for each number that was entered was a headache. So going back and forth to the different files to make sure they relate to one another proved to be successful. This was a new experience for me, a couple fumbles, but that didn't deter me from reaching the endzone.
